%==  as shown in the figure below

%==  success as defined by, eventually approved by FDA and make it to the market
%==  therefore, there is always motivation to "start right", or "start better" with a compound that is more likely to pass the subsequently ADMET tests
%==  in which leads to:


%==  following the step of target identification
%==  in which step, the target of the disease is identified
%==  target is officially defined as a bio-chemical entity, that when combined with drugs, unergoes a specific interaction that has connection with clinical effects.
%==  (this is an older illustration graph),
%==  with the development of computer science, it's taking a role in drug discovery in the screening step which is termed as 'in silico' virtual screening
%==  Virtual screening (VS) is a computational technique used in drug discovery to search libraries of small molecules in order to identify those structures which are most likely to bind to a drug target
%== it helps decide which compunds to sythesise, test for ADMET properties next


%== here introduce my motivation for this proposal: better molecular docking results that will eventually to applied to virtual screening of a real-scenario target



%==%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%== this proposal targets at improveing the accuracy of virtual screening results,
%== as my research into virtual screening shows that,
%== there are researchers spending a lot effort building more "accurate" scoring functions for molecular docking
%== there are researchers writing protocol for evauluating the functionality of newly developed scoring functions
%== and people have, published numerous amounts of literature debating on which docking software performs better on which benchmark datasets
%== there are researchers developing standard operating procedure for performing virtual screening
%== but it lacks customize between docking and virtual screening



%== this proposal adds an additional step between within the virtual screening process to costomized the screening for better resutls.

%== the general framework for in silico virtual screening is illustrated in this figure
%== the actual screening part, which is, step #3
%== is categorized into ligand based or receptor-based.
%== when looking at a specific practical screening scenario
%== researchers first evauluate: do we have a high resolution structure of the receptor?
%== if so, use the receptor-based virtual screening
%== if not, follow through the ligand based virtual screening, which involves different kind of modeling of the probelm
%== in my proposal, i assume that i have the structure of the receptor
%== therefore virtual screening will rely on molecular docking






%== to describe the general pipeline of the virtual screening process
%== first the protein needs to be identified
%== second, the 3d structure should be downloaded and preprocessed
%== third define the active site , along with 3d structures and perform molecular docking
%== ligands with high binding affinitys ouputed by the software



%== the figure on the left describes the basic concept of molecular docking
%== which is, given the 3d structure of the receptor and the ligand
%== evaluate how the two bind into one entity



%==  When referring to molecular docking, generally it is defined as: Computational approaches that 'dock' small molecules into the structures of macromolecular targets and 'score' their potential complementarity to binding sites are widely used in hit identification and lead optimization
%==  when practically performing a molecular docking event, these are the aspects that we want to the dockign software to give us answers to
%==  first is,

%== this is sometimes termed as, the orientation, conformation, sampling
%== the difficulty of the sampling question scales with how much flexibility the ligand and the receptor has
%== this step is performed by the docking software normally using a genetic algorithm, or monte carlo algorithm



%== task number 2, accurately predit the binding affinity of a small molecular from receptor-ligand interactions.

%== this is normally referred to as the scoring question
%== the scoring functions are used both to guide sampling, and to rank the sampled poses
%== scoring function are categorized into force field based, knowledge based, and empirical ones
%== force-field ones seek to quantify the actual molecular forces that exist between the ligand and the receptor, accounting for van der waals interactions, electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions
%== knowledge based seek to derive simplified potentials directly from databases of structural data, which often end up in a pair wise addition of atoms in the same neighborhood
%== empirical incorporate dlements of both mentioned above,, they consit of phusically meaningful terms that are parameterized, they are somewhat similar to force field terms but also contains more complicated- not- modellable terms. They are trained on co-crystalized structure with known binding affinities, therefore it's highly dependant on the training data.
%== with the progression of computer science, recent years has seen machine learning based scoring functions, they are sometimes catergorized into the empirical categoried, there are also literature put them into a 4th category: descriptor based scoring functions.
%== Both catory makes sense somehow, 1st, "machine learn" meaning training, the there is a physical model of converting the interaction between the ligand and the receptor into descriptors, in which case 'descriptor based is also appropriate, because machine learing relys on the numerated descrptors, and depending the descriptor intepretation, the major trends on this category have employed
%== k-nearst neighbor, naive bayes, random foreset -> decision tree, support vector machine, nerural network, convolution network
%== there are different methodalogies, i will elaborate on svm, which will be the method i use for learning, please note that this is a different scenario than to implement the machine learning in the actual scoring function.
%== as the current development:  most docking programms
%== reasonably good at finding the correct pose for a given protein-ligand complex
%== less good at ranking different ligands aginst the same protein (which arises problem in virtual screening)




%== in this case, when you set if the binding affinity exseeds certain amount, it can be clssified as a binder or non binder





%==%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%== here is my first proposal
%== instead of the simple virtual screening pipleline as described above, and as practiced routinely,
%== the docking parameters will be trained prior
%== instead of just feeding the ligands into the docking software
%== each input ligand will have different docking parameters



%== on this left is my architechture for aim 1
%== to begin with, i want optimized docking parameters
%== to what standard that i optimize to parameters to?
%== CASF! same ppl maintaining the PDBbind dataset.
%== btw, pdbbind is a database, that include the protein-ligand and bio experimental datasets
%== they newly published a protocol on how to use a refinemnet core set of complexes to evaulate the functionality a newly developed scoring functions
%== as mentioned above, docking = sampling + scoring
%== these two functionalities are tested as the powers as listed
%== they are conveniently written into bash scripts and outputs as numbers for evaulations.
%== therefor, i will initially use the default parameters to dock
%== raise output by (e.g. 10%) and the pass threshold




%== for performing the docking, here i use smina, not necessaily smina
%== smina is a fork of the famous autodock vina
%== usage of smina rather than vina, is because it goes into vina and offered more tweaking parameters for user to define
%== here offers a abbreviated list of the user defined parameters
%== the author of smina phrased this as the 'user-defined' scoring function, because when comparing to vina, vina only offers running parameters of : search box location,  number of cpu to use, random seed, exhaustiveness of the search, number of modes, and the energy range
%== whereas in smina, below is just a subset of parameters that can be specified.
%== 1.0 at beginning of each line is the weights to be put onto the parameter specified.
%== the full weights list will be the configuration that's updated is the docking software does not pass the CASF evaluating protocol
%== I plan to random updating scheme initially,
%== but further investigation can be done to construct a hierrachy of the list





%== this step uses RDKit to transfer the properties of ligand into molecular descriptors.
%== RDKit is waht i identified as a mature packages that can be easily incooporate into the pipeline, but alternative molecular descriptor can be used in this step as well.







%== to describe what is molecular descriptor, it converts the molecular structrue into computer recognizable language
%== below offers an example of how molecular descriptor works that i find to be illustratable with simplified equations



%== this is a pair wise, distance-dependant addtion method, which is common for machine learning based scoring functions(but that's not really relevant in this scenario)
%== cuttoff = 12, 12 angstrom within the neighborhood
%== j, i specifis atom types
%== K,L total number of
%== Z returns the number count




%== for this step, i plan to use svm that's packages in matlab, sklearn, or tensorflow, since i will have 195 training data sets
%== to explain svm conceptually, consider the plot on the top right
%== data that's linearly un-separatable becomes linearly separatable in the fearture space
%== briefly, svm project input data into a higher dimension using a kernel function
%== the linear separation line is termed as hyper plane.
%== relys on the unlinearity of the kernel function, actually depend on the charasteristic of the data, which could would be investigated as in which one to use, but i plan to use the Raial basis fucntion kernel






%==%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%== two terms, active slection vs bio-active
%== svm, some concept, with different application
%== firt, svm is used in this situation as a classification of binder or non binder, ranther than a regression problem as descibed for the architechture in aim 1

%== also it could be set as update 100 times before and settle on the optimal parameter, still, no theorectical garantee that it will converge
