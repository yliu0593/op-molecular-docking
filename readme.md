Hi, this is Youlin's original proposal of "Machine learning assisted virtual screening architecture in drug discovery". 

([What is "original proposal?"](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/academic_programs/graduate/gradrequirements.php))
>Candidacy Examinations. To establish candidacy, each student must pass five written "cumulative" examination questions within their first four semesters and an oral examination prior to the end of their fifth semester of graduate study. The oral examination by the student's advisory committee will include a discussion of the student's research and defense of an original research proposal that is different from the student's thesis research.

Not sure how practical it is, but if anyone is interested in implementation shoot me an email!
